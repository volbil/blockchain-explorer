# Simple blockchain explorer with ElectrumX backend
Nice and simple blockchain explorer based on slightly modified [ElectrumX](https://github.com/MicroBitcoinOrg/ElectrumX/) server :3

Feel free to modify/use it in your projects :D

## TO DO
- Network stats
- Update getCirculatingSupply calculations that go beyond 5th halving period

P.s. Working example [http://explorer.volbil.com](http://explorer.volbil.com/)
